## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Getting Started

[![Open in Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Open%20in%20Codespaces-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/brignano/brignano.io)

The fastest way to get started is to open this repository in a [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or any compatible Dev Container environment by clicking the badge above.

This will automatically set up your development environment with all dependencies pre-installed.

---

#### Manual Setup (optional)

If you prefer to run locally without a Dev Container:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brignano/brignano.io.git
   cd brignano.io
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Resume Content

The resume is now integrated directly into the application and accessible at `/resume`. It features a dedicated layout with theme toggling, PDF download functionality, and comprehensive professional experience.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production (static export to `out/` directory)
- `npm run start` - Start Next.js production server (not used for static exports; serve the `out/` directory with a static file server instead)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

## 📦 Building for Production

Next.js is configured with static exports to ensure compatibility with various hosting platforms:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `out/` directory.

## 🚢 Deployment on Vercel

This project is optimized for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com):

### Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own version with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrignano%2Fbrignano.io)

### Manual Deployment

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
2. Import your project to Vercel:
   - Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Select your repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js framework
   - Click "Deploy"

Vercel will automatically:

- Build your Next.js application
- Deploy to a global CDN
- Provide automatic HTTPS
- Set up preview deployments for pull requests
- Enable Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights (already configured)

### Deploying with Vercel CLI

Use the Vercel CLI to deploy from your machine or CI. Commands vary slightly by CLI version — prefer `npx vercel` if you don't want a global install.

1. Authenticate and link the repo:

```bash
vercel login
vercel link       # or `vercel link --yes` to auto-confirm
```

2. Deploy:

```bash
# interactive preview deploy
vercel

# production deploy (non-interactive)
vercel --prod --confirm
# or with npx
npx vercel --prod --confirm
```

3. Fetch environment variables locally (when needed):

```bash
# older CLI: positional
vercel env pull .env.local production

# newer CLI: long option
vercel env pull .env.local --environment=production
```

Notes:
- `vercel env add <NAME> production` adds a variable to the Vercel project; run `vercel env pull` afterwards to fetch it locally.
- For CI, set env vars in the Vercel dashboard or use the Vercel Git integration.


## 🏗️ Infrastructure

Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) for this site is maintained in a separate repository:

- `brignano/aws` — contains Terraform/CloudFormation and deployment configuration used to provision cloud resources for this site and related projects. See https://github.com/brignano/aws for details.

### Environment Variables

If you need environment variables for your deployment:

1. Go to your project settings on Vercel
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add your variables for Production, Preview, and Development environments

### Analytics (gtag)

This site sends events via Google Analytics using the helper in `lib/gtag.ts` and the `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` constant. The file is located at `lib/gtag.ts` and the `event()` helper is used throughout the codebase to send analytics events (e.g. contribution graph interactions).

Notes about the default analytics setup:

- `lib/gtag.ts` currently provides a default, hardcoded `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` value. You do not need to configure Google Analytics to run or build the site locally — the hardcoded ID will be used by default.
- If you want to use your own Google Analytics property, either set `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` in Vercel environment variables or add it to a local `.env.local` file (example below).

To enable your own Google Analytics (optional):

```env
GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-YOURIDHERE
WAKATIME_API_KEY=your_wakatime_api_key_here
```

Generating `.env.local` from Vercel CLI

If you already have environment variables set up in the Vercel dashboard, you can pull them into a local `.env.local` file using the Vercel CLI. Follow these steps exactly:

1. Install the Vercel CLI (if needed):

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. Authenticate and link the local repo to the Vercel project (this is required so `env pull` knows which project to read from):

```bash
vercel login
vercel link
# or `vercel link --yes` to auto-confirm when you already know the project
```

3. Pull environment variables into `.env.local` from the linked Vercel project. Specify the environment if needed (production/preview/development):

```bash
vercel env pull .env.local --environment=development
```

Notes and troubleshooting:

- `vercel env add <NAME> <environment>` only sets a variable on Vercel (it will prompt for the value) — it does not automatically write to your local `.env.local` file.
- `vercel env pull` reads variables from the currently linked Vercel project. If variables are missing after `env pull`, ensure your local repo is linked to the correct Vercel project (`vercel link`) and that you have permission to read that project's variables.
- To re-check or re-link the project use `vercel link --yes` or run `vercel` and follow the interactive prompts.
- If you prefer to add variables directly via CLI to Vercel (not local), you can run:

```bash
vercel env add GA_MEASUREMENT_ID production
vercel env add WAKATIME_API_KEY production
```

After adding variables on Vercel, re-run `vercel env pull .env.local --environment=production` to fetch them into your local file.

Be careful not to commit secrets — `.env.local` should remain local and is usually ignored by Git.

Required variables for development:

- `WAKATIME_API_KEY` — required to render the WakaTime coding statistics on the `/coding` page. If this is not set the coding page will show an error when fetching WakaTime data.

Optional:

- `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` — only necessary if you want analytics sent to your own Google Analytics property; otherwise the default hardcoded value will be used.

## 📝 Configuration

### Next.js Config

The `next.config.ts` is configured for static exports:

- `output: "export"` - Enables static HTML export
- `images.unoptimized: true` - Disables server-side image optimization
- `basePath: ""` - Set to your repository slug if deploying to a subdirectory

### Vercel Analytics

Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights are already integrated via:

- `@vercel/analytics`
- `@vercel/speed-insights`

These packages are automatically enabled when deployed on Vercel.
